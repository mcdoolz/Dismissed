# Dismissed

A Chrome plug in for dismissing LinkedIn job results by string.

## Are you tired of seeing hundreds of listings for fake jobs?

You're not alone. Hi, I'm Dooley and I'm not just a programmer, I'm also tired. Tired of seeing hundreds of listings for fake jobs.

Wouldn't it be convenient to just dismiss them all at once?

_Well now you can!_

Introducing, Dismissed! The way to get rid of all LinkedIn listings that you don't want to see at the press of a button.

TODO:
Remove the listings and invoke the UI to lazy load more, and remove those until we hit the end of the page of results.

I'm always open to suggestions.
